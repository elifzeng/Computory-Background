## 报告摘要
### intro
- why train model: estimating the probability distribution of data (from large data set)  
- model application: generate novel data points (a generative model) or evaluate probability for poteintial data point.
### how to train generative model
- aim: minimization true value and pred value
- output: needed to be nowmalized. But it is difficult to tackling the intractable normalizing constant.
