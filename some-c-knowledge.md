# Computer Background

## [Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)

Metadata is "data that provides information about other data". In short, it's data about data. Many distinct types of metadata exist, including descriptive metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata, reference metadata and statistical metadata.

Descriptive metadata is descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
Structural metadata is metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships and other characteristics of digital materials.
Administrative metadata is information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.
Reference metadata is information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
Statistical metadata, also called process data, may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.

## compliation/ compile (编译语言)

[编译](https://baike.baidu.com/item/编译)就是把高级语言变成计算机可以识别的2进制语言，计算机只认识1和0，编译程序把人们熟悉的语言换成2进制的。
Compilation is to turn a high-level language into a binary language that the computer can recognize. The computer only knows 1 and 0. The compiler replaces the familiar language with binary.
Explainment:

1. The process of generating a target program from a source program written in a source language by a compiler.
2. Use the compiler to generate the action of the target program.

The working process of the compiler to translate a source program into a target program is divided into five stages: lexical analysis; syntax analysis; semantic checking and intermediate code generation; code optimization; object code generation. Mainly for lexical analysis and grammar analysis, also known as source program analysis, grammatical errors are found during the analysis, and prompt information is given.

## scripting language （脚本语言）

 A script or [scripting language](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/script.htm) is a computer language with a series of commands within a file that is capable of being executed without being compiled. Good examples of server-side scripting languages include Perl, PHP, and Python. The best example of a client side scripting language is JavaScript. A full list of scripting languages and other programming languages can be found through our programming language definition.

## Macro (宏)

简单而言，[宏](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science))就是一种批量处理的称谓，它根据一系列预定义的规则替换一定的文本模式。用途在于自动化频繁使用的序列或者是获得一种更强大的抽象能力。
A macro (short for "macroinstruction", from Greek μακρός 'long') in computer science is a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to a replacement output sequence (also often a sequence of characters) according to a defined procedure. The mapping process that instantiates (transforms) a macro use into a specific sequence is known as macro expansion. A facility for writing macros may be provided as part of a software application or as a part of a programming language. In the former case, macros are used to make tasks using the application less repetitive. In the latter case, they are a tool that allows a programmer to enable code reuse or even to design domain-specific languages.
