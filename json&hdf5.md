总的来说，json在数据读取时需要将整个文件(string type)读进内存，进而转化为number等类型，其数据精度在小数点后6位，它较为通用。
而HDF的结构使其可以只读取指定的部分文件，其数据精度（浮点数保留位数）不受限制，一般在量化领域等使用。

# Json
[Json in wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
### Introduction
JavaScript Object Notation is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as replacement for XML in AJAX systems.

JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. JSON filenames use the extension `.json`.

### Data types and syntax

JSON's basic data types are:

**Number**: a signed decimal number that may contain a fractional part and may use exponential E notation, but cannot include non-numbers such as NaN. The format makes no distinction between integer and floating-point. JavaScript uses a double-precision floating-point format for all its numeric values, but other languages implementing JSON may encode numbers differently.
**String**: a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. Strings are delimited with double-quotation marks and support a backslash escaping syntax.
**Boolean**: either of the values true or false
**Array**: an ordered list of zero or more values, each of which may be of any type. Arrays use square bracket notation with comma-separated elements.
**Object**: an unordered collection of name–value pairs where the names (also called keys) are strings. Objects are intended to represent associative arrays,[7] where each key is unique within an object. Objects are delimited with curly brackets and use commas to separate each pair, while within each pair the colon ':' character separates the key or name from its value.
**null**: An empty value, using the word null
**Whitespace** is allowed and ignored around or between syntactic elements (values and punctuation, but not within a string value). Four specific characters are considered whitespace for this purpose: space, horizontal tab, line feed, and carriage return. In particular, the byte order mark must not be generated by a conforming implementation (though it may be accepted when parsing JSON). JSON does not provide syntax for comments.

Early versions of JSON (such as specified by RFC 4627) required that a valid JSON text must consist of only an object or an array type, which could contain other types within them.

### Write dictionary with json format
```python
d1 = {
    'a': {
        'a1': {
            1: [0],
            2: [0],
            3: [0]
        },
        'a2': {
            5: [0],
            6: [0],
            7: [0]
        }
    },
    'b': {
        'b1': {
            2: [1],
            3: [1],
            4: [1]
        },
        'b2': {
            6: [1],
            7: [1],
            8: [1]
        }
    },
    'c': {
        'c1': {
            3: [2],
            4: [2],
            5: [2]
        }
    }
}# d1为一个嵌套字典
f = open('a.txt','w')
f.writelines()
f.close()
```
此时`a.txt`中只有第一层字典的key值:
```txt
abc
```
[解决办法](https://www.cnblogs.com/xiexiaokui/p/10788828.html)：  
```python
import json
js = json.dumps(d1) # json.dumps 用于将 Python 对象编码成 JSON 字符串。
f = open(fp,'w')
f.write(js)
f.close()
```

# Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5)
[HDF in wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format)
**Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)** is a set of file formats (HDF4, HDF5) designed to store and organize large amounts of data. Originally developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, it is supported by The HDF Group, a non-profit corporation whose mission is to ensure continued development of HDF5 technologies and the continued accessibility of data stored in HDF.

In keeping with this goal, the HDF libraries and associated tools are available under a liberal, BSD-like license for general use. HDF is supported by many commercial and non-commercial software platforms, including Java, MATLAB, Scilab, Octave, OCaml, Mathematica, IDL, Python, R, Fortran, Common Lisp, and Julia. The freely available HDF distribution consists of the library, command-line utilities, test suite source, Java interface, and the Java-based HDF Viewer (HDFView).
